# image_styling_tg_bot

This is an english version of [my final project](https://github.com/tipofyzik/ImageStyling_tgbot) that I've made on the [Deep Learning School course by MIPT](https://dls.samcs.ru/en/dls).

Brief explanation of my project's goal: It was neccessary to create a telegram bot that can transfer image style from one image to another. The bot should be based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). An additional goal was to deploy the bot to the server. For not wasting the resources of the server the bot was stopped. You can run your own by downloading repository and following the deploy server instruction (see below).
