# image_styling_tg_bot

This is an english version of [my final project](https://github.com/tipofyzik/ImageStyling_tgbot) that I've made on the [Deep Learning School course by MIPT](https://dls.samcs.ru/en/dls) this june. The original was written in russian, so you can translate it with google. I changed the structure of the text a little, but the essence is the same

Brief explanation of my project's goal: First of all, it was neccessary to create a telegram bot that can transfer image style from one image to another. The bot should be based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). An additional goal was to deploy the bot to the server. I've done both of them! Entire code was written in Python.

For not wasting the resources of the server the bot was stopped. You can run your own by downloading repository and following the deploy server instruction (see "Docker and deploy" section).  
My telegram bot: @image_styling_tg_bot

## About the repository usage before we start
  1. Folder "Notebook": it contains notebook and neccessary photos for it.This is solely required for showcasing the operation of the chosen GAN.
  2. To run your own bot you need:  
     **•** Download the "tgbot" folder, the "app.py", and the "API.txt" files.  
     **•** [Create your own bot](https://sendpulse.com/knowledge-base/chatbot/telegram/create-telegram-chatbot#create-bot) (read the 1st chapter).  
     **•** Copy an API that was given by @BotFather and put it in **API.txt**  
     **•** Install all required libraries (see "requirements.txt")  
     **•** Run "app.py"
  3. If you wanna run your bot through docker you also need to download the dockerfile and follow the instruction from the "Docker and deploy" section
